Hi Guys,
This program is OpenCV using python code for the face recognition feature, only by looking at the screen one can unlock their phone screen. Although fingerprint is the most used way of authentication in mobile phones, face detection is rapidly gaining popularity and acceptance.

Hope you enjoy the code
